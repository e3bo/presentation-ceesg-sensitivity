#This par provides a general definition of sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a term I often hear people use to mean
essentially a check that your results do not dramatically change when
you change your model parameters, but it a has a broader definition.

-sensitivity vs uncertainty
-local vs global

#This par introduces Sobol indices

A standard method of global sensitivity analysis is to decompose the
variance in a model's output into functions of successively larger
sets of input variables.

#This par describes how to calculate Sobol indices in R

The sensitivity package makes calculating Sobol indices in R easy.

# This par describes difficulties that occur with stochastic models

Calculating Sobol indices for stochastic models is a bit more complicated.

# This par describes the joint metamodeling approach of Marrel et al.

A paper by Marrel and coauthors describes an approach to sensitivity
analysis for stochastic models.

# This par describes how to fit a joint metamodel in R

There are several R packages that assist in fitting a metamodel.

# This par describes how to visualize the metamodel

Often, we'd like to view the metamodel response and data to assess
goodness of fit and learn more about how the parameters affect the
response.

# This par recommends references for further reading

I found several articles very helpful for learning about these methods.
